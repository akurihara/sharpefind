Sharpefind is an Android application to help Brown University students coordinate meals.  
Using the Foursquare API, the app allows them to check in at campus eateries and find friends who are currently dining. 

See who's eating right now by glancing at your Friends List. It'll tell you which dining hall they're in, 
how long they plan to be there, and even which section they're sitting in.
Want others to join you? Check in to any dining hall using the step-by-step instructions. 
Your friends will be able to see your check in on their Friends List.
Deciding whether to eat on campus in the first place? Use the Menu tab to see what's being served and inform your decision.
